unaty Operator	              Explanation


Unary plus (+)	             Tries to convert the operand into a number

Unary negation (-)	     Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after

Increment (++)	             Adds one to its operand

Decrement (--)	             Decrements by one from its operand

Logical NOT (!)              Converts to boolean value then negates it

Bitwise NOT (~)	             Inverts all the bits in the operand and returns a number

typeof	                     Returns a string which is the type of the operand

delete	                     Deletes specific index of an array or specific property of an object

void	                      Discards a return value of an expression.



Binary Operator                        Explanation

&	AND	                   	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	                 	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	XOR	                 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~	NOT	                  	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	   	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	  	Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
>>>	Zero fill right shift	    	Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
